Mantras
-
> "Essentially, all models are __wrong__, but some are __useful__" - Georges Box

>> The __"Separation Of Concerns"__ principle is your friend   
_(And the <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/Dicho-Scope/blob/master/Introduction_EN.md">Dicho-Scope</a> is your favorite - conceptual - tool)_

>>> The __"intention"__ is more important than the __"extension"__   
_(The reason why a thing is in the map is more important than the nature of this thing)_   
More about that here : <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EntangledBootstrap/blob/master/1_Semantic/Model_EN.md">2-level Model</a>
