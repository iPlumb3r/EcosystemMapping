Setting in context
==
In the context of E2M we have :
* Big Question = "WHO ?"
* Meaning = Who acts ? Who is involved ?
* Corresponding intentional concept : <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMapping/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%40Agent.md">@Agent</a>

This __intentional concept__ embodies a "target" whose role can be played by a series of __extensional concepts__ that are :

Classically:
* <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMappingModel/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%C2%A7Person.md">§Person</a> : A particular individual
* <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMappingModel/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%C2%A7Organization.md">§Organization</a> : A set of <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMappingModel/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%C2%A7Person.md">§Person</a> or <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMappingModel/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%C2%A7Organization.md">§Organization</a>   

But potentially it could just as well be one or the other of the following concepts:
* §Project : Particular initiative of a §Person or §Organization
* §Software : A software-type product (e.g. : An AI instance that performs taxonomies)
* §Product: Product of material type (e.g. : An autonomous "taxi" car that offers ride)
* Or something else I haven't thought of yet ... 

Consequence
==
So there is NOT on one side of ITEMS/Individuals who are <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMapping/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%40Agent.md">@Agent</a> and on the other side of ITEMS/Individuals who are <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMappingModel/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%C2%A7Person.md">§Person</a> (or <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMappingModel/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%C2%A7Organization.md">§Organization</a> or other) ...   
... BUT many ITEMS/Individuals who are SIMULTANEOUSLY both of the <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMapping/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%40Agent.md">@Agent</a> AND of the <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMappingModel/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%C2%A7Person.md">§Person</a> (or of the <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMappingModel/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%C2%A7Organization.md">§Organization</a> or other)

Benefits
==
This makes it possible to better manage the characteristics and relationships of each Concept, ...   
... Because each ITEM/Individual can be seen :
* either in relation to "what it DOES" (=> as an @Agent)
* either in relation to "what it IS" (=> as a §Person or an §Organization, or even as §Project or a §Product)

Example
==
Thus in the context of an ecosystem relating to the circular economy, one can imagine that : 
* each @Agent is characterized by a "re-use ratio" (corresponding to its recycling rate)
* each §Person is characterized by a "birth date" 
* each §Organization is characterized by a "size" (corresponding to the number of members)

In this context, we will then have:
* The ITEM/Individual "John Doe" will belong simultaneously to the TYPES/Classes §Person AND @Agent (and will thus be characterized by a "re-use ratio" AND a "birth date").
* The ITEM/Individual "RecycleAll" will belong simultaneously to the TYPES/Classes §Organization AND @Agent (and will therefore be characterized by a "re-use ratio" AND a "size")
