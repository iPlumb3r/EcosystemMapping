Question
==
It's basically about answering the key question "WHO?". More precisely :
* Who does it ?
* Who gets involved?

Intentional Concept
==
In ecosystem mapping, the one who acts is by definition the concept of <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMapping/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%40Agent.md">@Agent</a>.

> It is this concept that embodies what "DOES" ITEMS/Individuals in this category.

Extentional Concepts
==
The __intentional __concept__ of <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMapping/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%40Agent.md">@Agent</a> embodies a "target" whose role can be played by a series of __extensional __concepts__ which are 

Classic:
* <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMappingModel/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%C2%A7Person.md">§Person</a> : A particular individual
* <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMappingModel/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%C2%A7Organization.md">§Organization</a> : A set of <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMappingModel/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%C2%A7Person.md">§Person</a> or <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMappingModel/blob/master/1_Semantic/Conceptionary/%C2%A7Organization.md">§Organization</a>   

But potentially it could just as well be one or the other of the following concepts:
* §Project: A particular initiative of a §Person or §Organization (The §Project being seen as a temporary §Organization with a beginning and an end)
* §Software: A software-type product (ex: An AI instance that performs taxonomies)
* §Product: Product of material type (ex: A self-contained "taxi" car that offers shopping)
* Or something else I haven't thought of yet... *

> It is these concepts that embody what "ARE" the ITEMS/Individuals in this category.

Example
==
Thus in the context of an ecosystem relating to the circular economy, one can imagine that : 
* each @Agent is characterized by a "re-use ratio" (corresponding to its recycling rate)
* each §Person is characterized by a "birth date" 
* each §Organization is characterized by a "size" (corresponding to the number of members)

In this context, we will then have:
* The ITEM/Individual "John Doe" will belong simultaneously to the TYPES/Classes §Person AND @Agent (and will thus be characterized by a "re-use ratio" AND a "birth date").
* The ITEM/Individual "RecycleAll" will belong simultaneously to the TYPES/Classes §Organization AND @Agent (and will therefore be characterized by a "re-use ratio" AND a "size")
