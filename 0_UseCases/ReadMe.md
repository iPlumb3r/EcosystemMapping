This is the place for describing common use cases when trying to map a given Ecosystem

Case of SEAMLESS (Dogfooding at Works !)
-

<a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/SEAMLESS">SEAMLESS</a> is a initiative which aims to provide « as a service / platform » business applications (fully distributed & semantic driven) for helping organizations to design and produce cyber-physical products and associated services in an efficient way !

What are the "ingredients" of this use case ?
* The model is coming from <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMapping/blob/master/6_Ontologies/OWL-Ontology.md">E2M (Ecosystem Mapping Model)</a> extended by this specific <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EntangledBootstrap/tree/master/6_Ontologies">model</a>
* The methodology is roughly described in this <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/EcosystemMapping/blob/master/1_Semantic/ReasonWhyA2-LevelModel_EN.md">page</a>
* the data are coming from the <a href="https://github.com/iPlumb3r/SEAMLESS">SEAMLESS</a> initiative

Case of Holochain
-

Trying to map the <a href="https://www.topincs.com/EntangledBootstrap/1822">MetaCurrency</a> / <a href="https://www.topincs.com/EntangledBootstrap/1451">Holochain</a> / <a href="https://www.topincs.com/EntangledBootstrap/1701">Holo</a> ecosystem

How can we use the "Intention VS Extension" dichomony in order to map its related ecosystem ?

To Be Completed...
